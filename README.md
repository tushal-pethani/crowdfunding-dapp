## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

### `Crowdfunding.sol`

- Deploys new Project contracts  
- Returns all created projects  
- Allows contributions to a specific project  

### `Project.sol`

- Handles core project logic  
- Accepts ETH contributions  
- Marks project as Successful or Expired  
- Allows refunds or fund withdrawals with voting

## 🥺 Understanding Key Files

### `scripts/deploy.js`

- Uses Hardhat Runtime Environment to deploy the Crowdfunding contract on Localhost  
- Logs the contract address once deployed  

### `Crowdfunding.sol`

- Deploys Project contracts for each campaign  
- Maintains an array of all created projects  
- Handles contribution logic and event logging  

### `Project.sol`

- Handles contribution logic, deadlines, refund logic  
- Tracks withdraw requests with voting mechanism  
- Contains modifiers for role/access control  

### `hardhat.config.js`

- Contains Hardhat configuration, including custom network settings (e.g., localhost)

    cd ..
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile contracts:**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. **Start a local node:**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat node
    ```

5. **Deploy contracts:**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```
    → Copy the deployed contract address

6. **Paste the deployed contract address in:**
    - `client/redux/interactions.js` (line 13)

## 🔐 Security Note

- Do NOT upload private keys or .env files.  
- It is safe to upload the deployed contract address — it is needed by frontend apps and users to interact with your contract.
