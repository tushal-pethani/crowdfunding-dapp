📜 Smart Contracts Overview

Crowdfunding.sol
• Deploys new Project contracts
• Returns all created projects
• Allows contributions to a specific project

Project.sol
• Handles core project logic
• Accepts ETH contributions
• Marks project as Successful or Expired
• Allows refunds or fund withdrawals with voting

🥺 Understanding Key Files

scripts/deploy.js
• Uses Hardhat Runtime Environment to deploy Crowdfunding contract on Localhost
• Logs the contract address once deployed

Crowdfunding.sol
• Deploys Project contracts for each campaign
• Maintains an array of all created projects
• Handles contribution logic and event logging

Project.sol
• Handles contribution logic, deadlines, refund logic
• Tracks withdraw requests with voting mechanism
• Contains modifiers for role/access control

hardhat.config.js
• Contains Hardhat configuration, including custom network settings (e.g., localhost)

✨ How to Use

1. Clone repo:
   git clone https://github.com/tushal-pethani/crowdfunding-dapp.git

2. Install dependencies:
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   npm install

3. Compile contracts:
   npx hardhat compile

4. Start a local node:
   npx hardhat node

5. Deploy contracts:
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   → Copy the deployed contract address

6. Paste the deployed contract address in:
   client/redux/interactions.js (line 13)

🔐 Security Note
Do NOT upload private keys or .env files.
It is safe to upload the deployed contract address — it is needed by frontend apps and users to interact with your contract.
